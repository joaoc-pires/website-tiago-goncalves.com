My name is Tiago Gonçalves and I am an Assistant Professor and PhD in Management at ISEG – Lisbon School of Economics and Management, Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal. I have teaching experience at various levels of higher education, especially Bachelor’s and Master’s. 

My research interests are Knowledge Management, Human Resources Management and Organizational Psychology and Behavior. My recent research focuses on the characteristics of Knowledge Management and related phenomena in healthcare organizations, as well as counterproductive forms of knowledge behaviour. 

I am currently an Integrated Research Member at ADVANCE/ISEG Research - ISEG, ULisboa, where I research knowledge management and knowledge-related behaviors (with particular focus on healthcare organizations), Workplace Happiness, Human Resources Management, and contemporary subjects on Leadership. I am also a Program Committee Member for the International Institute for Applied Knowledge Management (EUA), a not-for-profit organization that advocates sharing and access to knowledge including education and research on applied Knowledge Management.

My research has been published in leading international journals (e.g. Journal of Business Research and International Journal of Information Management) and presented at both national and international conferences (e.g. Academy of Management, European Academy of Management and European Conference of Knowledge Management).
